    "2. `is_last_minute_booking`: Mark bookings as last-minute if purchase_lead is less than 5 days and flight_duration exceeds 6 hours. Last-minute bookings often indicate higher commitment due to urgency.\n",
    "3. `trip_scale`: Calculate as num_passengers * length_of_stay * wants_extra_baggage. This can suggest a larger, more planned group trip, often associated with higher commitment, although it could also indicate the complexity of coordinating a group.\n",
    "4. `early_flight`: Mark flights as early if flight_hour < 7:00 AM, representing flights taken early in the morning.\n",
    "#### Dropping Feature\n",
    "1. `booking_origin`: Drop this feature as it is unlikely to have a significance prediction on booking completion.\n",
    "2. `flight_hour`: Drop this feature since, for non-urgent and very early flights, the specific hour may not impact the booking completion as much."

    "Overall, Model 2 (using the undersampling method) and CatBoost performed better than other models for classifying Case 1. When it comes to classifying potential lost customers, both Model 2 and CatBoost are recommended. Going forward, further model tuning and feature engineering could be explored to enhance performance. Additionally, potential solutions for addressing class imbalance include neural networks and treating the problem as an anomaly detection task."
